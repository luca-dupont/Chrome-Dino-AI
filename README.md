# Chrome Dino Game AI

## What does it do? 
This app, using Python and the PyGame module, plays the Chrome no-wifi dino game and uses generative AI to get better and better at it.

## Usage
1. Install Python packages mentioned in the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file to meet the required imports in `main.py`.
2. Run the `python main.py` from within the folder.
3. Watch the AI learn and press SPACE to see the best from the last generation!

### Requirements
The following packages are required for this script to work.
- PyGame
- Random
- Numpy

To install these packages, you can simply run: `pip install -r requirements.txt`


#### Issue :
You can press space to show the best player from the last generation, i was unable tho to turn off key repeat so sometimes it will not work.
