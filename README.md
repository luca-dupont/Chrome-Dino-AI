# Chrome Dino Game AI
> NN generative AI to play dino game

## What does it do? 
This app, using Python and the PyGame module, plays the Chrome no-wifi dino game and uses generative AI to get better and better at it.

## Usage
1. Install Python packages mentioned in the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file to meet the required imports in `main.py`.
2. Run the `python main.py` from within the folder.
3. Watch the AI learn and press SPACE to see just one player!

### Requirements
The following packages are required for this script to work.
- PyGame
- Numpy

To install these packages, you can simply run: `pip install -r requirements.txt` inside the directory


#### Issue :
You can press space to show one player from the last generation. I was unable though to turn off key repeat, so sometimes it will not work.
